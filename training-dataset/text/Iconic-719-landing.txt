This audio recording captures the immediate aftermath of an incident involving aircraft "Iconic 719" during landing. The primary concern is a suspected tire issue indicated by "heavy vibration," "smoke," and a "loud pop" reported by the flight crew. Consequently, the air traffic control tower coordinates with emergency services, other ground vehicles, and the airline's operations to assess the situation, ensure the safety of the four individuals on board, and plan for the aircraft's removal from the runway, which is confirmed as having four flat tires on the main gear. The conversation highlights the collaborative effort to prioritize safety, gather critical information (like the number of people on board and any medical needs), and initiate the necessary logistical arrangements like providing passenger transport and maintenance assistance.

Iconic 719, you okay? This is 79, are you okay?

We've got some uh heavy vibration on the roll.

Okay. Uh yeah, we saw a lot of smoke and we heard a loud uh pop. Uh well, we're going to get the trucks out there for you.

Right. Thank you. Yeah, it feels like a rough roll, so we might have a fire.

Okay, rocket. Yeah, we're assuming flat tire. But we're going to get the trucks out just as a precaution.

And any uh Tro vehicle on frequency

Tower T 9 is in route to runway one naut showing 19 closed. As a heads up for operations copying one niner closed

and t 99 just be by old delta lima. What is that? Lima 3 now. Tower 99 from limo one like runway 99 proceed on runway one niner cross runway 24 proceed on one n cross 24 n and confirm one niner we're showing runway one niner is closed and v 79 do you need to evacuate there or are you guys okay still

we're okay we could just have someone in the carriage for any fire issues and then we can

uh 79 no bomb on their way. They'll be there in the next 10 seconds.

So, we'll keep engines running. We just need an inspection of the under

and the two vehicle 99 and then any fire trucks that are on on the frequency. Just be the engines are still running. You just need an inspection currently.

And tower 9 if I'd like to take a look in the main intersection. 29. Roger. Proceed into the main again.

We will um going to proceed into the main intersection of 24 run 9. I'll report one off 99. Roger.

So from our side 719, we had some rapid acceleration without uh initial braking. So we just need to see if uh we might have hit something on the runway or uh next step is to check that all our tires are still inflated. just roger and 99 or did you hear that

tower copies we'll inform the 99 he's out of the vehicle roger and u standby

and v 79 the fire truck emergency vehicles are looking to talk to you on 125.1 and um you can relay all that information and they'll relay more information to you 5.1

fire truck from visited 719. How do you reach? We had some uh rapid deceleration after touchdown without specific uh addition of the brakes and then some movement some some uncontrolled movement to the right. So if you could check if all the the tires are still inflated or if there's any damage uh more specifically on the right hand side. Our our engines are all running at this time. You need them shut down. All right, we're all shut down now. Vet 719. All right, from Vet 719, engines are fully shut down. You might still hear the APU running. But that's no risk to him walking around.

Any update?

How many souls on board?

We've got four of them.

Okay. Is there any volume of any medical?

Negative.

Thank you.

Roger.

Right now, I just have the personnel doing a perimeter with a camera.

Thank you. 074 ground. Any update?

All right. Thank you. One program aircraft. Go ahead. All right. All copy. So you can confirm all the tires are still inflated. All right. Thank you.

Rescue one t operation.

Rescue one. Guard.

Yeah. Rescue one t operation. Do you have a on board.

I believe it was four.

Four. Copy. Thank you.

Do you have the status? Was it a uh tire?

Hey, firm. All uh for what we see. As you guys are reporting, all tires are deflated. The surface check from Tro 9 came back clean. No debris on the runway. No,

no debris on the runway, but they have flat tires. And do you know you said all the tires are flat?

That is what the trucks are reporting us.

That's what they were reporting. Okay, thank you.

So just to confirm for this 719, we'll keep the doors closed until we see transport outside or should we open the door already?

And 9 hotel Victor Juliet Alpha operations down frequency.

We are on on 1251. Is this where you're calling?

Hey, affirmative. Um, I just wanted to let you know, uh, we have a tug from Atlantic Aviation on the way as well as a shuttle bus for passengers. Um, I just wanted to make you aware though, it looks like all four tires on the main gear are flat. Um, so I'm not sure how uh tugging the aircraft's going to go.

All right, check. Yeah, I think we'll need to get in touch with our maintenance department as well. And just confirm whether it's uh good to move. But for now, thanks for the transport and we'll uh we'll have the passenger on there as soon as as it arrives.

Okay, roger that. And uh just be advised, we do have uh dollies at the uh in our operations hanger. We have two of them uh that are rated for larger aircraft. Uh so it's possible we'll be able to use, but uh we'll we'll figure that out once we get in touch with maintenance and everything. All right, guys. Yeah, we'll make some contact with our guys and and uh just get Go ahead. Thanks for the help from uh Victor Chin at Alpha

and 98 Victor Juliet Alpha operations. Uh can I just have an idea how many uh people you have on board?

We've got four. Three crew, one passenger. If we could just get shuttle out here for the passengers to get uh keep them on schedule.

Copy that. Our bus is on the way right now and uh copy. Three crew, one passenger. Thank you.
